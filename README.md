**README: R Log Analysis Project**

**Overview:**

Welcome to the R Log Analysis Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing log files using the R programming language. By leveraging data obtained from Python log analysis merged files, we perform data cleansing, processing, and visualization to derive valuable insights from the log data.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - We begin by importing clean log data obtained from Python log analysis merged files into R.
   - The data undergoes cleansing and processing, including the conversion of time and date into POSIX format.
   - Null rows are removed using the `omit()` function to ensure the integrity of the dataset.

2. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - To facilitate efficient analysis, we create a sample dataset comprising 1000 rows from the cleaned log data.
   - This sample dataset serves as the basis for generating dummy reports and conducting various analyses.

3. **Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Using the `ggplot2` package, we create a diverse range of charts, including bar plots, line plots, scatter plots, and histograms.
   - Additionally, we utilize the `plotly` package to produce interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore the data dynamically.

**Usage:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure that you have R installed along with the required packages (`ggplot2`, `plotly`, etc.).

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Import clean log data obtained from Python log analysis merged files into R.
   - Perform data cleansing, processing, and conversion of time/date into POSIX format.
   - Remove null rows using the `omit()` function.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Use the sample dataset of 1000 rows to generate dummy reports and conduct analysis.
   - Explore different charts and visualizations created using `ggplot2` and `plotly`.
